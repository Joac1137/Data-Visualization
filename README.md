# Data-Visualization
An important part of the Data Visualization course is the semester-long course project. In this project, you will develop an interactive data visualization for a dataset of your own choosing. There are many good reasons for such a practical project running alongside the course – some of which are:  
<ul>
    <li>To understand how the concepts, algorithms, and frameworks from the lecture relate to practical questions and issues of visualization; </li>
    <li>To test-drive your visualization skills in an environment of frequent constructive input and guidance from your peers and the lecturer; </li>
    <li>To apply your visual literacy and critical thinking skills to evaluate your own work; </li>
    <li>To showcase what you’ve learned in this lecture in a tangibe way that goes beyond the mere grade (e.g., as part of a project portfolio for job applications); </li>
    <li>To find out whether data visualization is actually your thing and which aspects of it you like best (graphic design, software engineering, data analytics, visual storytelling / data journalism,...) </li>
    <li>To prepare you for a potential MSc thesis project in visualization. </li>
</ul>
