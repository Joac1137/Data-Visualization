# Data-Visualization
An important part of the Data Visualization course is the semester-long course project. In this project, you will develop an interactive data visualization for a dataset of your own choosing. There are many good reasons for such a practical project running alongside the course – some of which are:  To understand how the concepts, algorithms, and frameworks from the lecture relate to practical questions and issues of visualization; To test-drive your visualization skills in an environment of frequent constructive input and guidance from your peers and the lecturer; To apply your visual literacy and critical thinking skills to evaluate your own work; To showcase what you’ve learned in this lecture in a tangibe way that goes beyond the mere grade (e.g., as part of a project portfolio for job applications); To find out whether data visualization is actually your thing and which aspects of it you like best (graphic design, software engineering, data analytics, visual storytelling / data journalism,...) To prepare you for a potential MSc thesis project in visualization. To wet your appetite for this project and to give you an inspiration for your own project, this page gathers some of the projects from previous runs of the data visualization course.
